title: How to Configure your Teleport Cluster
description: An introduction to Teleport's dynamic configuration resources, which make it possible to apply settings to remote clusters using infrastructure as code.
---

Teleport provides three methods for configuring RBAC, single sign-on, and other
aspects of your cluster that often change regularly. 

All three methods connect to the Teleport Auth Service's gRPC endpoint in order
to manipulate cluster configuration resources stored on the Auth Service
backend. The design of Teleport's configuration interface makes it well suited
for infrastructure-as-code and GitOps approaches.

## YAML documents with `tctl`

You can define configuration resources as YAML documents and apply them using
the `tctl` client tool. Here is an example of a `role` resource that allows
access to servers with the label `env:test`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['ubuntu', 'debian', '{{internal.logins}}']
    node_labels:
      'env': 'test'
```

Since `tctl` works from the local filesystem, you can write commands that apply
all configuration documents in a directory tree, e.g.,:

```code
$ find ./my-resources -name "*.yaml" -exec tctl create -f {} \;
```

## Teleport Terraform provider

Teleport's Terraform provider lets you manage your Teleport configuration
resources within the same infrastructure-as-code source as the rest of your
infrastructure. There is a Terraform resource for each Teleport configuration
resource. For example:

```text
resource "teleport_role" "developer" {
  metadata = {
    name        = "developer"
  }

  spec = {
    allow = {
      logins = ["ubuntu", "debian", "{{internal.logins}}"]

      node_labels = {
        key   = ["env"]
        value = ["test"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Teleport Kubernetes Operator

With The Teleport Kubernetes Operator lets you apply Teleport configuration
resources as Kubernetes resources so you can manage your Teleport settings
alongside the rest of your Kubernetes infrastructure. Here is an example of a
`TeleportRole` resource, which is equivalent to the two roles shown above:

```yaml

apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v5
kind: TeleportRole
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['ubuntu', 'debian', '{{internal.logins}}']
    node_labels:
      'env': 'test'
```

Operator](./configuration/kubernetes-operator.mdx).
